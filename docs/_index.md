## Language

Throughout this documentation, source code comments, development notes, commit messages, etc. I tend to use these terms interchangeably depending on my mood, whims, and brainstate. I could probably come up with more formal/rigorous definitions but no need to get too far off into the weeds. 
* engine ⇔ host ⇔ world ⇔ game
* bot ⇔ wasm ⇔ module ⇔ guest ⇔ player
