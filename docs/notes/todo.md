## dev
* resume work:
  * doing line of sight coding in the `engine/src/game/map.ts` file. 
  * disallow diagonal movement if config is set that way

* trainer
    * need to figure out debugger attaching to the process; maybe deno can just take a port number and hit it up instead of starting it directly? 
      * set up monorepo as a VS Code workspace? https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces
      * https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_compound-launch-configurations
    * reset functionality got moved around; test it out
    * clean the server code the heck up
        * would be nice if it could recover from a panic, but not sure what would even happen then
* botloader not using Loader? (I assume I had a reason, because it *is* imported...)
* exploration
  * have world send slice that accounts for line-of-sight (TODO marked in world's `runTurn` function)
  * set up exploration following pseudcode notes in `bot.zig`
* toast messages / notifications
  * like for player registration failure that right now just prints to console
* distribute the min tick across # of players?
  * would also allow for tweening of movements (you know you have X amount of time before you're moving again)
* UI: 
    * file select or drag and drop for running your own bot
    * add player image to panel once spawned
    * button to zoom on particular bot
* BUG: failed instantiation still adds player to UI

* is `makingNewPlayer` still needed or can we just make it separate?


* map variations
    * add map parameter to embedded component
* testing
    * player class
      * feeding non-wasm byte array
      * feeding invalid wasm
      * feeding program that refuses start
      * feeding program that crashes on setup
      * passing negative or invalid string length
* line of sight and vision area
* items, weapons, armor, spells
* web trainer
  * first UX:
    * runtime configuration of timeout values (to disable)
    * add hooks to wasmcoordinator to stop in the middle of a tick until advanced
    * make a kind of "null bot" that just returns Wait messages
    * flowcontrol needs to know which function to call when pausing, etc. 
    * show game circumstances message on left (editable?), nothing on right
    * TICK
    * gray out / lock game circumstances, show message received from the program on right
    * pull down menu to choose different message types
  * allow seeding of world (and show seed)
* build out a few different example bots (./bot_concepts.md)

# procgen
* https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/
* figure out how to make visual layer from data w/tiled for procgen
    * this might be a pain in the ass... 


## polish
* player class
    * set facing when reset
* clean up / organize Zig library; just kind of a mess right now
* UI: landscape view on iPhone - the drawers don't extend into the island areas
* Tech: ability to reseed player on reset
* Trainer:
  * author + load JSON files of message sequences
    * means generating code to serialize/deserialize messages from JSON ðŸ˜¬
  * single executable that hosts webpage
    * https://github.com/NfNitLoop/deno-embedder
* CI to build/validate/deploy


## horizon
* move to library for phosphor icons?
  * https://github.com/haruaki07/phosphor-svelte
  * https://github.com/babakfp/phosphor-icons-svelte
* monsters! 
  * TypeScript-driven AIs, very basic behaviors
  * stat blocks read from JSON?
* game player objects should have labels that world can see
  * update world.ts processMove error handler once they do
* with the move away from extern linking, maybe more libraries can use normal strings in their BotMetadata structs
* readmes for individual libraries
* custom Phaser3 build to trim down export size
  * then lower the `chunkSizeWarningLimit`

## far-flung future
* allow teams? hooboy, whole other layer of functionality

## bugs
* in web ui: switching bot while still running: gotta fully detach and dispose of the old one
