## dev
* modify handshake expectations
  * âœ… api json
  * âœ… engine
  * client libraries + examples
    * âœ… C
    * Zig
    * (leaving others for now while I let these shake out for a bit)
  * procedure:
    * update bot version number
    * new `clientReceiveGameParams` function that takes `InitialParameters` and returns bool for "yes I'll play)
      * should setup be done here? hrm. 
      * setup extern as necessary
    * `clientSetup` loses parameters,
    * `receiveGameParams` loses second parameter
      * now reads a `InitialParameters` from the offset instead of manually parsing
      * returns result of `clientReceiveGameParams`
      * does not write bot name/version anymore; moved to `setup`
    * bot metadata (if existing) loses `ready` member
* toast messages / notifications
  * like for player registration failure that right now just prints to console
* distribute the min tick across # of players?
  * would also allow for tweening of movements (you know you have X amount of time before you're moving again)
* UI: 
    * file select or drag and drop for running your own bot
    * add player image to panel once spawned
    * button to zoom on particular bot
* systems:
    * rename Move to MoveTo
    * set params handshake to use messages
* failed instantiation still adds player to UI
* map variations
    * add map parameter to embedded component
* testing
    * player class
      * feeding non-wasm byte array
      * feeding invalid wasm
      * feeding program that refuses start
      * feeding program that crashes on setup
      * passing negative or invalid string length
* line of sight and vision area
* items, weapons, armor, spells
* trainer
  * first UX:
    * runtime configuration of timeout values (to disable)
    * add hooks to wasmcoordinator to stop in the middle of a tick until advanced
    * make a kind of "null bot" that just returns Wait messages
    * flowcontrol needs to know which function to call when pausing, etc. 
    * show game circumstances message on left (editable?), nothing on right
    * TICK
    * gray out / lock game circumstances, show message received from the program on right
    * pull down menu to choose different message types
  * allow seeding of world (and show seed)
* build out a few different example bots (./bot_concepts.md)

# procgen
* https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/
* figure out how to make visual layer from data w/tiled for procgen
    * this might be a pain in the ass... 


## polish
* player class
    * set facing when reset
* UI: landscape view on iPhone - the drawers don't extend into the island areas
* Tech: ability to reseed player on reset
* Trainer:
  * author + load JSON files of message sequences
    * means generating code to serialize/deserialize messages from JSON ðŸ˜¬
  * single executable that hosts webpage
    * https://github.com/NfNitLoop/deno-embedder
* CI to build/validate/deploy


## horizon
* move to library for phosphor icons?
  * https://github.com/haruaki07/phosphor-svelte
  * https://github.com/babakfp/phosphor-icons-svelte
* monsters! 
  * TypeScript-driven AIs, very basic behaviors
  * stat blocks read from JSON?
* game player objects should have labels that world can see
  * update world.ts processMove error handler once they do
* with the move away from extern linking, maybe more libraries can use normal strings in their BotMetadata structs
* readmes for individual libraries
* custom Phaser3 build to trim down export size
  * then lower the `chunkSizeWarningLimit`

## far-flung future
* allow teams? hooboy, whole other layer of functionality

## bugs
* in web ui: switching bot while still running: gotta fully detach and dispose of the old one
