## dev
* game stuff
  * deal with:
    * player dropping when bot selector changes
    * move to library for phosphor icons?
      * https://github.com/haruaki07/phosphor-svelte
      * https://github.com/babakfp/phosphor-icons-svelte
  * UI: 
    * add player image to panel once spawned
    * upload wasm with drag-n-drop (or at least a file selector)
  * embedded component
    * take map parameter (once there are multiple maps)
  * testing
    * player class
      * feeding non-wasm byte array
      * feeding invalid wasm
      * feeding program that refuses start
      * feeding program that crashes on setup
  * line of sight and vision area
  * items, weapons, armor, spells
* map variations
* trainer
  * single executable that hosts webpage
    * https://github.com/NfNitLoop/deno-embedder
  * visualization of memory, enter options from dropdown
    * edit memory
  * author + load JSON files of message sequences
    * means generating code to serialize/deserialize messages from JSON ðŸ˜¬
  * load a wasm file, let it take a turn
* build out a few different example bots (./bot_concepts.md)
* CI to build/validate/deploy

## polish
* player class
    * when dropping, if game hasn't started, put spawn point back in the pool
    * set facing when reset
* UI: add button to console to copy it to clipboard
* UI: landscape view on iPhone - the drawers don't extend into the island areas
* UI: text size on bot name? 
* Game: ability to zoom in on single bot
* Tech: ability to reseed player on reset

## horizon
* game player objects should have labels that world can see
  * update world.ts processMove error handler once they do
* with the move away from extern linking, maybe more libraries can use normal strings in their BotMetadata structs
* readmes for individual libraries
* custom Phaser3 build to trim down export size
  * then lower the `chunkSizeWarningLimit`
  * (other vis libraries that may be simpler/smaller than Phaser)

## far-flung future
* clang-format for c? (prettier or biome for TS / AssemblyScript?)
  * integrate with commit hook?
* look at all the exports in all the languages; see if we can organize/cleanup/hide stuff as needed
* think about some kind of test harness that checks all reads/writes work properly? 
* allow teams? hooboy, whole other layer of functionality

## bugs
* in web ui: switching bot while still running: gotta fully detach and dispose of the old one
* in Chrome, sometimes the worker hangs and doesn't get killed (especially when running the C bot)
* ok so something weird happens when running the C bot through Deno with the host.ts script
    * This should take 1.995 seconds (+ some startup/shutdown overhead) at the absolute most (assuming all the pre-warnings took 249ms), but the terminal reported it as 10.54 seconds. There are weird pauses in between prints. I would suspect GC shenanigans but (a) that doesn't make a ton of sense in this scope and (b) why would C run into it but not the others?

    * adding `v8-flags=--prof` to try and profile what's happening... makes the problem go away
      * apparently as does waiting a few hours! DON'T LIKE THAT
      * can't reproduce it now! 50 runs with `hyperfine` had a wholly acceptable sigma of 0.014s
      * wtf
