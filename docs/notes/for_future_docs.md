* flow control
  * refresh resets the states of the player programs to their initials, sets everyone to their starting hit points, and puts them back to spawn points
    * NOTE they may not be the *same* spawn points as initially
    * similarly the RNG is not put back to its initial state
    * this is not about reproducibility, just about running again
