One byte, 8 flags! (Could be more bytes, just for future-proofing? Part of me likes the commitment to simplicity, tho.)

1. Invisible (other players cannot see you)
2. Bound (cannot move or attack physically)
3. Silenced (cannot cast spells)
4. Poisoned (-X hp per turn)
5. Bioethereal (you can pass through other players, and they can pass through you)
6. Haste (you get two ticks every turn)
7. Slowed (you only get a tick every other turn)
8. [RESERVED]
