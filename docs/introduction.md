## Language

Throughout this documentation, source code comments, development notes, commit messages, etc. I tend to use these terms interchangeably depending on my mood and brain. Could probably come up with more formal definitions but we don't need to play that game. 
* engine ⇔ host
* bot ⇔ wasm ⇔ module ⇔ guest
