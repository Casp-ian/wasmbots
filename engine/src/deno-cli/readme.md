This is the only directory that really **relies** on Deno; other stuff should work find in Node or the browser. However, it's also pretty fluid; I kind of hack stuff together here while testing functionality when I don't want to keep hitting refresh in the brower. Eventually these will (hopefully) stabilize but for now don't assume anything here works without blowing some dust off it first.
