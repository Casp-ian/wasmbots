There is no "native" mode for running AssemblyScript, so no good way to make a trainer for it that would let you step through and debug.

Maybe something with browser dev tools? I know I can make debug builds from AssemblyScript, but it's less clear how I would integrate those the way the other libraries are.

Hmmm.
