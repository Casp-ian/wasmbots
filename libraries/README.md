A set of libraries that make it easier to write client modules for WasmBots in various programming languages. You don't **have** to use them; as long as whatever you build validates against the [API](../host/rsc/data/guestAPI.json) it will at least _run_. Mostly just a lot of convenience functions. Use them so much as they are useful.
