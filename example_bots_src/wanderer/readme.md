# wanderer (implemented in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)))

Super simple little bot. Picks a random direction and goes that way until it gets stopped. If there's a door on the path, it will roll some dice to decide how to deal with it (open it if it's closed, walk through it if it's open).

Watching the bots run around, this one often appears to be the least intelligent. Even the one that just runs in circles appears to have intent; this one is just baffling.
