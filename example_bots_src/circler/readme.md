## circler (implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))

Goes in a circle, opening any closed doors it finds and closing any open doors. Never goes **through** the doors, though, so will always be confined to the spawn room. 

I won't say this was inspired by how I always feel like I'm going in cursed circles when fighting with Rust's borrow checker, but I won't say it's _not_ inspired by that either.
